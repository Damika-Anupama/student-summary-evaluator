# Evalutaing Student Summaries

## Background

This is the code repository of Group 14 for CS3501: Data Science and Engineering Project at University of Moratuwa.

### Problem Statement

This project aims to address the challenge of assessing the quality of summaries created by students in grades 3-12. The objective is to develop a model capable of objectively evaluating the effectiveness of student-written summaries in terms of capturing the core concepts and details of a source text, while also assessing the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary. The availability of a dataset comprising genuine student summaries will facilitate the training of this model.
